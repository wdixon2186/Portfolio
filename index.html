          <p class="am">About Me</p>
          <p>
            I am a 26 year old full stack engineer who currently lives in
            Colorado Springs, Colorado. I was born and raised in Colorado, but
            attended school at Azusa Pacific University in California. Before
            attending APU, I went to University of Colorado - Colorado Springs
            where I took my first computer science class, and discovered how
            engaging, challenging, and rewarding programming can be.
            <br />
            <br />
            After obtaining my Bachelors degree from Azusa, I moved back home to
            Colorado, and was tasked with what career field to go into.
            Recalling how much enjoyment I recieved from my Intro to Java class,
            I decided to look into programming. I practiced HTML and CSS a bit
            before going through General Assembly's bootcamp.
            <br />
            <br />
            The bootcamp contained the longest days and the shortest weeks of my
            life. It was very challenging, and very rewarding. We worked with
            HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node, Express, Python, Django,
            MongoDB, SQL, and Postgres. We worked on assignments, attended
            lectures, and developed projects which you can see on my projects
            page. After I finished the bootcamp, I knew that coding was for me,
            because even though the days were long and stressful, there was
            nothing else I'd rather be doing.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I'm not programming, I'm usually at the movies, playing video
            games, or writing. You'll notice a heavy movie theme in most of my
            projects, because they've always been something I love. I even have
            a list of my top 10 films from 2019 in video format under the Films
            tab. I love to write scripts and edit videos in my free time too.
