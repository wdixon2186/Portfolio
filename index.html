      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is William Dixon and I am a web developer, a film lover,
        an adventure seeker, and a strong guy. If you need someone to work in
        front end and backend, tell you what the best movie of the decade is,
        fill you in on if you want to stop by Paris or Edinburgh on your
        luxurious vacation, or lift really heavy things up and put them down
        somewhere else, I just may be your person.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        My first project is called
        <a href="https://wdixon2186.github.io/movieTrivia/">Movie Trivia</a>. I
        created a trivia game centered around movie quotes, using HTML CSS and
        Javascript. Feel free to play it, if you feel comfortable with some more
        obscure movies. The second project I created is called,
        <a href="https://books-and-movies-db.herokuapp.com/movies"
          >Local Library</a
        >. I created this project to keep track of all of the movies and books I
        own. The site contains a database built in Node and express with full
        crud capability. My third project was actually a group project called,
        <a href="https://wdixon2186.github.io/City-Search-Front-End/#/"
          >City Fyndr</a
        >
        This project was built with Express and Node in the backend and React on
        the front end. The purpose was to provide census data for people
        considering moving to a top 50 city in the US. My fourth project is
        called,
        <a href="https://internet-makes-a-movie.herokuapp.com/"
          >Internet Makes A Movie</a
        >. It's purpose is to act as a social media platform and allow
        filmmakers to collaborate on making a movie together. This was built
        with Django, Python, and HTML.
