      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        My first project is called
        <a class="clean" href="https://wdixon2186.github.io/movieTrivia/"
          >Movie Trivia</a
        >. I created a trivia game centered around movie quotes, using HTML CSS
        and Javascript. Feel free to play it, if you feel comfortable with some
        more obscure movies. The second project I created is called,
        <a class="clean" href="https://books-and-movies-db.herokuapp.com/movies"
          >Local Library</a
        >. I created this project to keep track of all of the movies and books I
        own. The site contains a database built in Node and express with full
        crud capability. My third project was actually a group project called,
        <a
          class="clean"
          href="https://wdixon2186.github.io/City-Search-Front-End/#/"
          >City Fyndr</a
        >
        This project was built with Express and Node in the backend and React on
        the front end. The purpose was to provide census data for people
        considering moving to a top 50 city in the US. My fourth project is
        called,
        <a class="clean" href="https://internet-makes-a-movie.herokuapp.com/"
          >Internet Makes A Movie</a
        >. It's purpose is to act as a social media platform and allow
        filmmakers to collaborate on making a movie together. This was built
        with Django, Python, and HTML.

      <h2>Current Project</h2>
      <p>
        Right now I am studying React and Angular. As well as trying to get more
        familair with Python. I consider component based programming the bees
        knees, and plan to master it. I'll be creating projects with these
        languages.
