          My first project is called
          <a class="clean" href="https://wdixon2186.github.io/movieTrivia/new/will.html">Movie Trivia</a>. I created a trivia game
          centered around movie quotes, using HTML
          CSS and Javascript. Feel free to play it, if you feel comfortable
          with some more obscure movies. The second project I created is
          called,
          <a class="clean" href="https://books-and-movies-db.herokuapp.com/movies">Local Library</a>. I created this
          project to keep track of all of the movies and
          books I own. The site contains a database built in Node and express
          with full crud capability. My third project was actually a group
          project called,
          <a class="clean" href="https://wdixon2186.github.io/City-Search-Front-End/#/">City Fyndr</a>
          This project was built with Express and Node in the backend and
          React on the front end. The purpose was to provide census data for
          people considering moving to a top 50 city in the US. My fourth
          project is called,
          <a class="clean" href="https://internet-makes-a-movie.herokuapp.com/">Internet Makes A Movie</a>. It's purpose
          is to act as a social media platform and allow
          filmmakers to collaborate on making a movie together. This was built
          with Django, Python, and HTML.
          My most recent project is called, <a class="clean" href="https://wdixon2186.github.io/SnobAndSlob/">The Snob And The Slob</a> It is an updated version of a podcast site created a while ago on word press. I built this site with React.js, and am planning on continuing to work on the Back End to save our episodes.
