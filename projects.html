          My first project is called
          <a class="clean" href="https://wdixon2186.github.io/movieTrivia/">Movie Trivia</a>. I created a trivia game
          centered around movie quotes, using HTML
          CSS and Javascript. Feel free to play it, if you feel comfortable
          with some more obscure movies. The second project I created is
          called,
          <a class="clean" href="https://books-and-movies-db.herokuapp.com/movies">Local Library</a>. I created this
          project to keep track of all of the movies and
          books I own. The site contains a database built in Node and express
          with full crud capability. My third project was actually a group
          project called,
          <a class="clean" href="https://wdixon2186.github.io/City-Search-Front-End/#/">City Fyndr</a>
          This project was built with Express and Node in the backend and
          React on the front end. The purpose was to provide census data for
          people considering moving to a top 50 city in the US. My fourth
          project is called,
          <a class="clean" href="https://internet-makes-a-movie.herokuapp.com/">Internet Makes A Movie</a>. It's purpose
          is to act as a social media platform and allow
          filmmakers to collaborate on making a movie together. This was built
          with Django, Python, and HTML.

          I guess I should give you a link to my Github. Well
          <a class="clean" href="https://github.com/wdixon2186">here</a> you
          go.

        <p class="am">Current Project</p>
        <p>
          Right now I am studying React and Angular. As well as trying to get
          more familair with Python. I consider component based programming
          the bees knees, and plan to master it. I'll be creating projects
          with these languages.
